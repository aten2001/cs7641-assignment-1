To be able to run this code you will need JRuby which is easily downloaded via

http://www.jruby.org/download

I have also contained it as a zip file under /vendor. The easiest way to install jruby for this tool is to run ./bin/setup_jruby.sh which will extract and load the jruby script into the $PATH.

On top of JRuby I have attached all of the R code that created the graphics and a Makefile that helps make different things.
